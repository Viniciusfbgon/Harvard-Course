                    This means that most individuals of this breed can learn new commands in less than five seconds and follow them at least 95% of the time.
                    In other words, it is a very obedient furry and suitable for work.</p>

                Why should we have a dog according to <a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/promotions/harvard-health-publications/get-healthy-get-a-dog-the-health-benefits-of-canine-companionship">Harvard?</a>
              </h2>
              <p class="paragrafo">
                Above we have the ordered list of the top 3 most intelligent dogs. In this sense, dogs in general are essential for our daily lives,
                because in addition to being man's best friend, they are an excellent company that brings comfort, wards off need and loneliness. Furthermore, having a pet helps us to be more responsible,
                due to the daily care it requires. The company of a pet can be especially important for the elderly, as it helps occupy their mind and time.<br><br>
                Anyone who has a dog knows how much good these animals do for us, right? And anyone who loves dogs does not give up their company on any occasion, as they know the benefits of having a dog and the importance of dog love.

                If you are thinking about having a dog, know that it will require some work. You will practically have to take care of him like a child: give him food, water, bath, walks, play, give medicine when necessary and above all,
                give him lots of love! But it's all worth it, do you know why? Because dog love is priceless! They are loyal and true friends, who love you regardless of what or who you are. Did you know that there are many benefits of having a dog?

                If you work a lot, spend all day away from home and when you arrive you are tired and stressed, there is nothing better than having someone who loves you to welcome you and who has waited all day for your company. Your dog will inevitably
                cheer you up after a busy day! When you get home, he's going to have that party! Jumping, running from one side to the other, barking, licking you, eager to play and stay close to you! And in this friendship relationship, affection must be
                reciprocal. Certainly, with all this joy, there is no stress that lasts.<br><br>

                Furthermore, dogs can be considered social catalysts? Simply because they help people get out of the house, approach strangers easily and make new friends. Anyone who has a dog knows very well that when they go out for a walk with their dog, it often
                happens that they talk to another person who is also walking their dog, have fun, exchange experiences and stories about them, etc. Human socialization is very beneficial to health, even more so when dogs lend a little help!

                So, by being more active, you are less likely to develop depression. Dogs avoid people's isolation and, with their company, can help people to be happier and face their problems.

                The benefits of having a dog are countless, after all, with them we create very strong bonds of love, affection, companionship and friendship. Having one or more dogs is really nice, and it's really worth it, because our lives are much happier!
                Anyone who has a dog knows the importance of loving dogs.
