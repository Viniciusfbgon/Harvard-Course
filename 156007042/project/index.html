                Exercise is defined as any movement that makes your muscles work and requires
                your body to burn calorles, and grow up your muscles. There are many types of
                physical activity, such as swimming, running, walking, dancing, going to gym, and
                others. Being active has been shown to have many health benefits, both physically
                and mentally. As someone who engages in regular exercise, I can confidently say
                that the benefits are truly remarkable, for exemple when I make exercise a part of my daily
                routine, I feel like a whole new person, both physically and mentally, because
                exercise has a transformative effect on my physical well-being. Regular workouts
                help me maintain a healthy weight, improve my cardiovascular health, and
                strength my muscles and it may even help you live longer. According to Arlene Semeco, MS, RD -Medically
                reviewed by Jake Tipane, CPT, below is a list of the best effects when we do
                exercises:<br><br>

                <b>Exercise can make you feel happier:</b> It produces changes in the parts of the brain
                that regulate stress and anxiety. It can also increase brain sensitivity to the
                hormones serotonin and norepinephrine, which relieve feelings of depression.
                Additionally, exercise can increase the production of endorphins, which are known
                to help produce positive feelings and reduce the perception of pain.<br><br>

                <b>Exercise can help with welight loss:</b> Pratcing exercises coupled with diet, a reduced
                calorie intake will lower your metabolic rate, which can temporarily delay weight
                loss. On the other hand, regular exercise has been shown to increase your
                metabolic rate, which can burn more calories to help you lose weight.<br><br>

                <b>Exercise can increase your energy levels:</b> Exercise can be a real energy booster for
                many people, including those with varlous medical conditions
                As you move more, your heart pumps more blood, delivering more oxygen to your
                working muscles, With regular exercise, your heart becomes more efficient and
                adept at moving oxygen into your blood, making your muscles more efficient.<br><br><br><br>

                <strong>How to start exercising?</strong><br>

                I believe the best way to approach exercises
                is by finding a routine that suits your personal
                preferences and goals. Everyone is unique, so
                what works for one person may not work for
                another. However, I can share some general
                guidelines and principles that can help you
                make the most of your workouts. Also it's
                important to set realistic and achievable
                goals. Whether you want to lose weight, gain
                muscle, improve cardiovascular fitness, or
                enhance your overall well-being, having a
                clear objective will provide direction and
                motivation. AS well as its essential to
                consider a few things before starting a new
                workout routine. The three main things to
                consider are:<br><br>

                <b>Check your health:</b> It's
                important to consult your healthcare
                provider and get a physical medical
                examination before
                starting an exercise routine. This is
                particularly important for those new
                to strenuous and vigorous physical
                activities. An early checkup can
                detect any health problems or
                conditions that could put you at risk
                for an injury during exercise.
                It can also help you optimize your
                workout, making it easier for you and
                your personal trainer, if you choose to
                work with one, to understand your
                limitations and create an exercise
                plan tailored to your particular needs.<br><br>

                <b>Make a plan and set realistic goals:</b> Once you decide to start exercising
                regularly, try to create a plan that
                includes attainable steps and goals. One
                way to do this is to start with a plan of
                easy steps to follow. Then you can
                continue building on it as your fitness
                level improves. For example, if your goal
                is to finish a 5-kilometer run, you can start
                by building a plan that includes shorter
                runs. Once you can finish those short
                runs, increase the distance until you can
                run the whole 5 kilometers in one session.
                Starting with small achievable goals will
                increase your chances of success and
                keep you motivated every step of the
                way.<br><br>

                <b>Make it a habit:</b> Anotner key component of exercise success is to stick to your routine it
                seems to be easier for people to maintain an exercise routine in the long
                term if they make it a habit and do it regularly (9Trusted Source). A review of
                studies concluded that replacing an unhealthy behavior with a new healthier
                habit is an excellent approach to maintaining it in the long term (9Trusted
                Furthermore, making 2 schedule or exercising at the same time every day are
                Source).
                Good ways to sustain your routine and make it last. For example, you can
                make exercise a habit by planning to work out right after wOrk every day Or
                first thing in the morning. It's important to choose a time that works best for
                you.
                Probably the most importante thing is keep motivated and continue donig
                exercises, but how stay motivated?
                The key to staying motivated and making exercise a habit is to have fun while
                doing it. This helps you to not dread exercising, like the sample exercise
                program shown above, you can mix up activities while keeping it fun for you
                If you're able to and want to, joining a gym or taking a virtual fitness class like
                yoga or Pilates, hiring a personal trainer, or doing team sports are good ideas
                to help increase motivation and enjoyment (19Trusted Source). Working out
                as a group or with a friend can also help maintain accountability and
                motivate you to keep up your exercise routine.
                Furthermore, tracking your progress, such as logging your weightlifting levels
                or noting your running times, can help keep you motivated to improve your
                personal records.
                According to Harvard, one of the most recognized colleges, the best way to
                exercise is to do what you like, with pleasure. They did a study with 2354
                participants and the studies showed that the main sports are: "swimming, tai chi, strenght training and walking".<br><br><br><br>

                <strong>Why diet coupled with training we can have a better performance?</strong><br><br>
                <img class="eat" src="/img/dieta.png" ><br><br>

                You`ve probably heard that
                "you can't out-exercise a bad
                diet." While this saying has
                some merit, you may wonder
                whether diet or exercise is
                more important for health
                goals like weight loss or
                improved heart health. With
                endless health interventions
                out there, ranging from the
                80/20 rule to exercise-free
                diets, it can be hard to gauge if
                you should prioritize diet or
                exercise or if the answer lies
                somewhere in between. To lose weight you must be in
                a calorie deficit, meaning your
                body expends more calories
                than you consume. This can
                be achieved by eating and
                drinking  fewer calories,
                burning more calories from
                physical  activity, or a
                combination of the two.<br><br>

                Ultimately, combining dietary changes and
                regular exercise can help you achieve more
                meaningful and sustainable weight loss in the
                long term. When we talk about heart problems, diet is the
                most importante thing. The dietary patterns
                associated with reduced heart disease risk are
                centered around minimally processed
                vegetables, fruit, whole grains, healthy fats, and
                lean animal and plant-based proteins while
                being low in sodium. For example, the well
                established Mediterranean diet promotes heart
                health. It's high in healthy unsaturated fats from
                olive oil, fish, and nuts, dietary fiber from whole
                grains and vegetables, and antioxidants that
                help fight harmful molecules called free radicals.While both diet and evercise are
                important for weight loss, it's zeneralily eaier to
                manage your calorie intave by modifying your diet than it k to burn significanty
                more calories through ezercise, This may be why the 80/20 rule has become
                popular, as it states that weight loss is the resutt of 80% diet and 20% ezercise.
                For example, if you're airing for a daily calorie deficit of 500 calories, you could
                consume 400 fewer calories (80%) by eating lowier calorie dishes, srnaller portion
                sizes, and fewer snacks. Then, you only need to burn 100 calories (20%) from exercise.<br><br>

                Further, low levels of certain nutrients including zinc, vitamins D and B12, and
                omega-3 fats are linked with worsened mental nealth. Exercise can also provide
                both immediate and long-term benefits to mental health. It promotes the release
                of moad-boosting endarphins such as dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine
                that temiporarily improve your mood and stress levels
                Addicionaty, regular exercise is associated with lower rates of moderate
                depression, anxiety, and ather mental health conditions
                One more thing, to any treatment recommended to you by your healtheare
                professional regular exercise and a nutritious diet may improve your mental well-
                being.<br><br><br><br>

                <strong>BMI</strong><br><br>
                The Body Mass Index (BMI) is a widely used parameter to classify individuals according to their weight and height.
                Its use is widespread mainly among professionals who work with the body, such as doctors, physiotherapists and Physical Education professionals. It is It is
                important to highlight that the World Health Organization (WHO) uses this index as an indicator of the level of obesity in different countries."<br><br>

                Although this index is useful as an initial indicator of underweight or obesity, it is important to consider that it does not
                take into account body composition, such as the amount of lean mass and fat mass, which can limit its accuracy in specific cases of athletes. Studies indicate that calculating BMI is a reliable tool for assessing
                overweight and preventing obesity. However, it is essential to have regular consultations with the doctor for additional examinations. After all, they can identify aspects that BMI cannot.
                For example, boxer Mike Tyson, in his best professional phase, had a BMI of around 34 and was not obese.<br><br>

                In this sense, it is essential pay attention to the weight of children and adolescents. Just as excess fat is not good for health,
                neither is the other extreme. And, as a means of keeping an eye on the weight factor, the use of Body Mass Index is highly recommended.
                Therefore, if you notice any problems related to weight, refer the child to an endocrinologist and a responsible Physical Education professional.
                 By taking care of your diet and practicing regular physical activity, you can control the problem.<br><br>
